The mirror is not a passive object. It is an active participant in the act of seeing. When we look into a mirror, we are engaging in a feedback loop. Light bounces off our surface, hits the glass, and returns to our eyes. But what happens in that journey?

In the context of consciousness, the mirror represents the reflective capacity of the mind. We can turn our attention inward, observing our own thoughts and feelings as if they were external objects. This is the essence of the "mirror" in Ziggy Bent.

It is a tool for distancing oneself from the immediate experience of being, in order to understand the structure of that being.
