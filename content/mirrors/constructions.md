# The Nature of Constructions

Every construction is a tool, not a truth.

The personality you think you are - the beliefs, stories, preferences, roles - these are functional overlays. Useful for navigating the world, but not fundamental to what you are.

A construction can be changed, adapted, or released entirely. It's not fixed. It was never real in the way you thought.

What's real is the awareness that watches these constructions come and go.

The avatar serves a purpose. But you are not the avatar.

You are what's aware of it.
