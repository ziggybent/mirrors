# The Field That Contains Everything

You think awareness is something happening inside your head.

It's the opposite.

Awareness is the field in which everything appears - including the body, the thoughts, the sense of "you" reading these words right now.

The field doesn't need the body to exist. The body needs the field to be perceived.

This isn't philosophy. Look directly: where is the boundary between "inside" and "outside"? Where does awareness actually begin or end?

It doesn't.

You are not in the world. The world is in you.

Not the personal you. The awareness that has no edges.
