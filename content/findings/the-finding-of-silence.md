excerpt: "Silence is not the absence of noise, but the presence of space."

We often mistake silence for emptiness. We think that if there is no sound, there is nothing there. But silence is a physical presence. It is a weight. It is a texture.

In our exploration, we have found that silence is the substrate upon which consciousness rests. Without silence, there can be no signal. The noise of the mind obscures the fundamental frequency of being.

To find silence is to find the ground.
