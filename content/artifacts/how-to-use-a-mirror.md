1. **Stillness**: Before you look, be still. The mirror cannot reflect a moving target clearly.
2. **Honesty**: Do not flinch from what you see. The mirror does not judge; it only shows.
3. **Patience**: The image may not make sense at first. Give it time to resolve.

Use this artifact as a starting point for your own practice.
